## 1.2.4 - 20/07-17
The warden menu now has a 'Toggle Cell Doors' option to open cell doors. You need Smart Jail Doors for this to work and setup all celldoors yourself.  
Added command sm_open to achieve the same thing as above.  
The menu now looks a bit more stylish with separators on top and on the bottom.  
Fixed an issue where a warden the round previously could have opened the menu before he or she died and then change settings next round.

## 1.2.3 - 09/06-17
The warden menu no longer closes automatically when chosing something.  
Fixed an issue where the playercount didn't change when a T disconnected from the server.

## 1.2.2 - 01/06-17
Added a Hide n' Seek configuration menu. This opens when selecting HnS in event days.  
HnS will now end automatically when a specified amount of T's are remaining. (1 or two). This prevents wardens from abusing the HnS godmode during LR.  
Various bug fixes.
